# UAS7 Form

## About

This is project was created to help me fill the UAS7 (Urticaria Activity Score) form that has to be completed over 7 consecutive days.

The responses will help the doctor assess how active the Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) is.

Currently, the application language is portuguese (Brazil), but I will add english support later on.

## Contributing

For now, I will not accepet any pull requests. At least not until I finish the app. I want to code this application from the ground up, so I can improve my Flutter skills.

After the end of the basic project, I will be open to fixes, improvements and new features.

05/08:
    ✔ Add save button to form screen @done(20-08-06 01:23)
    ✔ Add "About UAS7 Form" screen @done(20-08-13 01:18)
    ✔ Before the creation of a new form, the user must input the day which the form is refering to @done(20-08-17 01:25)
        I can place the current day as the default value to make it easier for the 
        user (done)
        This input is not before, it is the first input in the form
    ☐ Save information to the Hive database
        For saving and retrieving data I don't think I need something too complex.
        So I found this simple and lightweight key-value database.
        Day schema:
            {
              "date": "27/8",
              "itch": 3,
              "wheals": 1"
            }
        Week schema (HiveList):
            {
              "days": [
                {
                  "date": "27/8",
                  "itch": 3,
                  "wheals": 1"
                }
              ]
            }
            
    ☐ Retrieve information from the Hive database

    I think I should tranform the ListTiles from the menu into a component
    It will probably help me in the future.
